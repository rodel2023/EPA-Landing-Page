            And to prove it, here’s a snapshot of one of affiliate accounts on Clickbank, bringing me consistent $100k+ a month at the peak of Covid19, through affiliate email marketing. No matter the economy or the location you are at, this business is recession and weather proof.

          <h4>
            You’ve probably heard a lot of incredible stories about people who make six-figure incomes from affiliate marketing programmes like ClickBank, Digistore24 or WarriorPlus, and think ‘are they even real’? The truth of it is, there ARE people who make an easy six-figures, and there are others who try but fail to make anything! So the question you should be asking yourself is not ‘is it POSSIBLE to make a full-time income with affiliate marketing?’, but ‘is it something that I can make work for ME?’.
          </h4>
          <br>
          <h4>
            Everyone wants to be a financial success, and the lure of an ‘easy’ way to make money is tempting, soooo tempting. But what not everyone realises is that there’s no such thing as a simple ‘get rich quick’ scheme, because if there was, wouldn’t everyone be doing it?  
          </h4>
          <br>
          <h4>
            So while affiliate marketing may not be for everyone, there are a number of signs that it’s something you can do to make a full-time income. Whether that income leaves you just ‘comfortable’ (and hey, many people are OK with just OK!) or whether you can reach the dizzying heights of six-figures, well, that’s up to you…
          </h4>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>
            <b>
                1. You’re a positive person
            </b>
          </h4>
          <h4>
            Whenever I see struggling affiliates – complaining that the system doesn’t work (here’s a clue, it probably doesn’t work for THEM), testing and not seeing results, and ultimately giving up because the process is ‘too slow’ – it reminds me that if I’d chosen to complain about the process or let my negative thoughts take over, I wouldn’t be where I am today.
          </h4>
          <br>
          <h4>
            <b>
              2. You’re dedicated to seeing things through to the end
            </b>
          </h4>
          <h4>
            Are you the type to give up when the going gets tough? Then honestly, affiliate marketing probably isn’t for you. You need to understand that along your journey there will be many challenges and dark moments faced before you succeed, just like my own journey. Those feelings were so vivid – that emptiness of not knowing what the future holds, and not knowing if I’m just living on empty faith – and it still scares me when I think back. I wished I had someone to hold my hand and tell me what the next step is, but, heck, life doesn’t always show you which path to take. I was committed to seeing things through, and I can’t tell you how thankful I am that I did.
          </h4>
          <br>
          <h4>
            <b>
              3. You won’t get scared at seeing big fat zeros in your account
            </b>
          </h4>
          <h4>
            I can’t lie – seeing that amount, nothing, nada, zilch, staring back at me on ClickBank for consecutive days, even weeks, did give me the occasional wobble and wonder if I should give up. In fact, if you’d have told me in those days that I could be making even $2k a month affiliate marketing was possible, let alone $10k and beyond, I would have probably laughed at you. But once I started seeing the money coming in, it started small but soon snowballed into the big numbers.
          </h4>
          <br>
          <h4>
            <b>
              4. Your expectations are realistic
            </b>
          </h4>
          <h4>
            You have to understand that people who sell these affiliate marketer training courses are simply trying to market their product. Would you buy a product that says, “learn my ultra-slow and very difficult method to succeeding in affiliate marketing!” That type of thing doesn’t sell courses, which is one reason I don’t sell any of my own training products. On the other hand, someone else might say, “learn how I made $50,000 in one month using the Amazon Associates affiliate program!” WOW! Now that sells!
            <br>
            <br>
            …Of course, once you get into the course, you discover that certain critical pieces of information are missing or it actually takes a ton of work or huge financial investment. There is always some barrier. Why? Like I said, affiliate marketing is not fast and easy. So, when you take one of those courses expecting to learn how to become an affiliate marketer fast and easy, you end up just feeling discouraged.
          </h4>
          <br>
          <h4>

              5. You’re adaptable

          </h4>
          <h4>
            The people who stick too rigidly to their ideas aren’t the right type of people to make a success out of affiliate marketing. Maybe they think their area of expertise is too small, or they can’t find anything in the affiliate marketing arena that fits in with their niche, or what they’ve been doing so far. While it may be true that some niches do better in the affiliate marketing world, you don’t have to be an expert in whatever you choose to make a bomb!
            <br> <br>
            Successful marketers don’t just stick with one product, anyway, they DIVERSIFY. Promoting different products from various merchants means you don’t have too drastic an issue if the merchant is slow to pay, or the product doesn’t convert that well or is slow to bring in the money.  Keeping a number of irons in the fire protects you from many things that might go wrong, after all, it’s only ONE product or ONE merchant you’re having a problem with! Oh, and don’t feel like promoting products in the same niche from different merchants is being disloyal – there’s nothing wrong with doing that at all, and in fact, it’s extremely common. 
            <br> <br>
            There are some incredible influencers out there, selling digital products that truly change people’s lives, and behind the scenes there’s an army of affiliates making a killing marketing those products. I’m proud to be a leading part of that army, having mastered the art of converting cold leads into HOT buyers using nothing but emails!
